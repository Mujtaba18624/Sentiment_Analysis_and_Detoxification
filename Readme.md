## Sentiment Analysis and Detoxification using Agentic Workflow
This project focuses on sentiment analysis, toxicity detection, and detoxification of multilingual texts, particularly African languages and English. The pipeline includes a translation module to convert African languages to English, followed by sentiment and toxicity detection models. The toxicity detection model also detoxifies toxic texts. The workflow is built using the LangGraph library, which integrates all components efficiently. The project evaluates the performance of sentiment classification, toxicity detection, and detoxification, highlighting challenges such as inference time, GPU limitations, and translation efficiency. The results show moderate effectiveness in detoxification, with room for improvement in handling multilingual inputs and preserving sentiment nuances.
